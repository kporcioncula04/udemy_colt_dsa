what is a binary heap?
where do we use it?
what is max and min heap?

-binary heap is as compact as possible
-used to implement priority queues, graph traversal
-similar binary search tree but
-if it is a max binary heap : the parent is always larger than the children
                              the child must be smaller than the parent
                              no implied ordering between siblings

-if it is a min heap :

Priority queues

-DS where each elem has a priority
-higher elems are served before lower elem
